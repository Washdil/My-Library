# My Library Project

This project is simple web application that enables users to manage a personal library of books. Users can add new books , view the lists of books, remove books and toggle the read status.


## Files

### 1. 'index.html'

The HTML file defines the structure of the web page. It includes a title, a heading, a container for displaying the library, a button to add new books, a form to input book details, and the JavaScript file.

### 2. 'style.css'
The CSS file contains styles for enhancing the visual appearance of the library. It uses a clean and modern color scheme, provides proper spacing, and improves the readability of the content. The styles aim to make the web page more visually appealing.

### 3. 'app.js'

The JavaScript file contains the logic for managing the library. It includes functions to create book objects, add books to the library, display the library on the web page, remove books, toggle the read status, and handle form interactions. The file also includes event listeners for user interactions.


## How To Use
